# Heat Pump Cost Optimizer for Home Assistant

A custom Home Assistant integration that uses **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** to optimize heat pump operation and minimize electricity costs, while maintaining indoor comfort and domestic hot water availability. Integrates with **Tibber** for dynamic electricity prices and Home Assistant weather entities for temperature, wind, rain, and solar forecasts.

## Features

- **True Predictive MPC** — uses FULL 24-hour weather forecast trajectories for anticipatory control
- **Solar Anticipation** — reduces pre-heating when sunny weather is forecasted (the sun will heat for free)
- **Wind/Rain Anticipation** — increases pre-heating before forecasted bad weather (higher heat loss coming)
- **Two-zone thermal model** — separately models upper floor (radiators) and lower floor (slab floor heating)
- **DHW (Domestic Hot Water) optimization** — coordinates hot water heating with space heating
- **Enhanced heat loss model** — wind speed increases convective loss, rain increases envelope U-value
- **Solar heat gain calculation** — accounts for passive solar gains through windows
- **Buffer tank dynamics** — models the heat pump buffer tank coupling both heating circuits
- **Tibber integration** — uses real-time and day-ahead electricity prices
- **COP modeling** — adjusts for outdoor temperature–dependent heat pump efficiency
- **Real sensor feedback** — uses floor heating return temperature for slab state estimation
- **Multiple operation modes** — Auto, Comfort, Economy, Boost, Off
- **Rich sensor entities** — 27 sensors including DHW, predictive insights, per-zone temperatures
- **Climate entity** — virtual thermostat with full HA climate integration
- **Service calls** — manual optimization, mode changes, runtime parameter tuning

## How the Predictive Optimization Works

### True Anticipatory Control (Not Just Reactive!)

The key differentiator of this optimizer is that it uses **forecasted weather data** to make decisions about **current** actions. This is what makes it true Model Predictive Control:

#### Solar Anticipation Strategy
```
Current time: 22:00 (night, cheap electricity)
Forecast: Tomorrow 10:00-16:00 → 400-600 W/m² solar radiation

Traditional optimizer: Pre-heat slab during cheap night electricity ✓
THIS optimizer: REDUCE slab pre-heating because solar will heat it for free! 💰

Result: Less overnight heating → sun heats the slab tomorrow → SAVINGS
```

The optimizer analyzes the solar radiation forecast for the next 6-12 hours. If significant solar gain is expected (>200 W/m²), it reduces slab pre-heating by up to 40% because the sun will provide free heat.

#### Wind/Rain Anticipation Strategy
```
Current time: 14:00 (afternoon, moderate price)
Forecast: Tonight 20:00-06:00 → 8-12 m/s wind + rain

Traditional optimizer: React to wind when it arrives (too late!)
THIS optimizer: INCREASE pre-heating NOW while electricity is cheaper! 🏠

Result: Thermal mass pre-charged → house stays warm through bad weather → COMFORT
```

The optimizer analyzes wind speed and precipitation forecasts. When bad weather is coming:
- **Wind effect**: Convective heat loss increases by `wind_sensitivity × wind_speed` (default 15% per m/s)
- **Rain effect**: Wet building envelope U-value increases by `rain_multiplier` (default 15%)
- Pre-heating is prioritized during cheap periods before the bad weather arrives

### DHW (Domestic Hot Water) Optimization

The optimizer coordinates DHW heating with space heating:

```
Heat Pump Capacity: 5 kW total
├── Space Heating: 0-5 kW (variable)
└── DHW Heating:   0-5 kW (variable)
    Total:         ≤ 5 kW (capacity constraint)
```

#### Demand time frames

Hot water is only *required* during the time frames you configure — for example
`06:00-08:30, 17:00-22:00`. This is the single biggest lever on DHW cost:

- **Inside a time frame** the tank is guaranteed to stay at or above the DHW
  minimum temperature (default 45 °C), so hot water is always available.
- **When a time frame opens** the tank is pre-heated to a "ready" temperature
  sized from the draw actually expected in that frame, capped at the DHW
  setpoint. A household that uses little water is never heated to 55 °C just
  because the setpoint says so.
- **Outside the time frames** there is no availability requirement at all. The
  tank is allowed to drift down, so no electricity is spent keeping water hot
  that nobody is going to use.

Time frames accept 24-hour times separated by commas, and may wrap past
midnight (`22:00-02:00`). Leave the field empty and the optimizer derives the
frames from the *learned* hourly usage profile instead. Switch the schedule off
entirely to require hot water around the clock (the pre-2.3 behaviour).

#### Cheapest-first production

DHW is a deferrable on/off load, so it is scheduled separately from the
gradient-based space-heating solve:

1. A cheapest-first planner walks the horizon, finds the first moment the
   requirement would be missed, and buys the missing energy from the cheapest
   preceding hours. Slot ranking uses an *effective* price that includes the
   standby heat lost while the water waits in the tank, so pre-heating very
   early is only chosen when it is genuinely cheaper.
2. Space heating is then optimized around that fixed DHW schedule, with the
   pump's remaining capacity during a DHW block bounding space heating power.

Because nothing in the objective rewards a hot tank for its own sake, price is
the only thing deciding *when* the pump runs for hot water. The result is
discrete heating blocks the pump can actually deliver, concentrated in the
cheapest hours, and no more heating to high setpoints during price peaks.

#### Anti-legionella

Since the tank is now allowed to cool between time frames, a periodic
disinfection cycle is enabled by default: every 7 days the tank is heated to
60 °C, scheduled at the cheapest hour before the deadline. The timer resets
whenever the tank is observed at the disinfection temperature for any reason
(planned cycle, manual boost, or immersion heater), so an already-hot tank never
triggers a redundant cycle.

Other behaviour:

- The optimizer models a time-of-day hot water draw pattern, masked by the
  configured time frames (learned from observed tank temperature drops).
- DHW tank thermal dynamics include standby losses and consumption draws.
- The tank is never planned above `min(70 °C, max(setpoint, legionella temp))`.

### Two-Zone Thermal Model

The house is modeled as two thermal zones served by a single air-to-water heat pump with a buffer tank:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │    Heat Pump (COP)       │

          │   Outdoor environment          │

          └───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Enhanced Heat Loss Model

The heat loss model accounts for forecasted weather at EACH time step:

**Wind effect** (convective heat transfer):
```
U_effective = U_base × (1 + wind_sensitivity × wind_speed)
```
- Default: 15% increase per m/s wind speed
- Example: 5 m/s wind → 75% higher heat loss coefficient
- Uses FORECASTED wind speed at each future time step

**Rain effect** (wet building envelope):
```
U_effective = U_wind_adjusted × rain_multiplier (when raining)
```
- Default: 15% increase during rain (rain_multiplier = 1.15)
- Scales with precipitation intensity (light rain → partial multiplier)
- Uses FORECASTED precipitation at each future time step

### Solar Heat Gain

Solar radiation through windows reduces heating need:
```
Q_solar = solar_radiation × window_area × orientation_factor × SHGC / 1000
```

Solar gains are split between zones:
- Upper floor: 40% (default) — light reaches upper level
- Lower floor: 60% (default) — sun hits lower floor through large windows

### Floor Return Temperature Feedback

When a floor heating return temperature sensor is configured, the optimizer uses it to correct the slab temperature model:
```
T_slab_estimated = 0.7 × (T_return + 1°C) + 0.3 × T_slab_model
```

### Backward Compatibility

When two-zone parameters are not configured, the model falls back to single-zone operation. DHW optimization is only active when a DHW temperature sensor or DHW tank volume is configured.

## Configuration

  solar_heat_gain_coefficient: 0.65
```

## Troubleshooting

### Temperature swings between zones
- Adjust `inter_zone_heat_transfer` (higher for open layouts)

### Solar over-heating in summer
- Reduce `window_area` or `solar_heat_gain_coefficient`
- Consider seasonal shading effects

### Floor heating slow response
- This is expected — slab has high thermal mass
- The optimizer accounts for this by pre-heating during cheap periods

### DHW too cold / too often heated
- Check the **hot water time frames** first — hot water is only guaranteed
  inside them, and outside them the tank is *meant* to cool down
- Water cold when you need it? Widen the time frame, or start it earlier
- Water cold at the very start of a frame? Raise `dhw_min_temperature`
- Still heating during expensive hours? The tank probably cannot store enough
  to bridge the peak — raise `dhw_setpoint` so more cheap energy fits in the
  tank, or shorten the time frame
- Decrease `dhw_daily_consumption` if the tank stays warmer than you need
- The `DHW Temperature` sensor exposes `dhw_in_demand_window`,
  `dhw_next_window_in_hours` and `dhw_required_temperature` so you can see
  exactly what the optimizer is being asked to deliver right now

### Predictive optimization not working
- Check that your weather entity provides hourly forecasts
- Check the "Predictive Insight" sensor for forecast analysis
- Solar anticipation requires solar irradiance in weather data
- Wind/rain anticipation requires wind_speed and precipitation in forecasts

## ECL110 MQTT Control (Heat Pump ON/OFF + Displace)

This integration can now drive an ECL110-compatible controller using two explicit outputs from MPC:

- `heat_pump_on` (boolean): whether supply should be enabled
- `displace_value` (°C): parallel shift command for ECL110 heat curve (published as integer to ECL110)

### MQTT command publishing

The coordinator now publishes the **preferred direct-write command** as a plain number to:

- `ecl110_displace_set_topic` (default: `ecl110/flow_temp_control/displace/set`)

Example payload:

```text
4
```

For backward compatibility, it can also publish a **legacy JSON payload** to:

- `ecl110_command_topic` (default: `ecl110/command`)

```json
{
  "source": "heatpump_optimizer",
  "reason": "scheduled_update",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "command": {
    "type": "ecl110_control",
    "heat_pump_on": true,
    "displace": 4
  },
  "context": {
    "price": 1.23,
    "mode": "pre_heat",
    "pre_heat_urgency": 0.6
  }
}
```

### New configuration options

- `ecl110_displace_set_topic`
- `ecl110_command_topic` (legacy JSON path)
- `ecl110_state_topic`
- `ecl110_mqtt_qos`
- `ecl110_mqtt_retain`
- `ecl110_displace_min` / `ecl110_displace_max`
- `ecl110_pid_time_constant_hours`

### PI/PID dynamics handling

ECL110 PI/PID response is approximated as a first-order lag, so internal displace commands are smoothed before dispatch, then rounded to integer values for MQTT output, and an `effective_displace` state is tracked for observability.
